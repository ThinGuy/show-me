   1. This build comes lxd containers acting as clients, and the server has registered itself as well.  You can automatically add more clients using either `add-landscape-clients-numbered.sh` or `add-landscape-clients-petnames.sh` scripts.  These scripts are located in `/usr/local/bin`.  You can also register any Ubuntu instance by following the instruction link on the left side of the dashboard.
