Category	Description
ami-id	The AMI ID used to launch the instance.
ami-launch-index	If you started more than one instance at the same time, this value indicates the order in which the instance was launched. The value of the first instance launched is 0.
ami-manifest-path	The path to the AMI manifest file in Amazon S3. If you used an Amazon EBS-backed AMI to launch the instance, the returned result is unknown.
ancestor-ami-ids	The AMI IDs of any instances that were rebundled to create this AMI. This value will only exist if the AMI manifest file contained an ancestor-amis key.
autoscaling/target-lifecycle-state	Value showing the target Auto Scaling lifecycle state that an Auto Scaling instance is transitioning to. Present when the instance transitions to one of the target lifecycle states after March 10, 2022. Possible values: Detached ; InService ; Standby ; Terminated ; Warmed:Hibernated ; Warmed:Running ; Warmed:Stopped ; Warmed:Terminated. See Retrieve the target lifecycle state through instance metadata in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
block-device-mapping/ami	The virtual device that contains the root/boot file system.
block-device-mapping/ebsN	The virtual devices associated with any Amazon EBS volumes. Amazon EBS volumes are only available in metadata if they were present at launch time or when the instance was last started. The N indicates the index of the Amazon EBS volume (such as ebs1 or ebs2).
block-device-mapping/ephemeralN	The virtual devices for any non-NVMe instance store volumes. The N indicates the index of each volume. The number of instance store volumes in the block device mapping might not match the actual number of instance store volumes for the instance. The instance type determines the number of instance store volumes that are available to an instance. If the number of instance store volumes in a block device mapping exceeds the number available to an instance, the additional instance store volumes are ignored.
